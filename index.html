  <p>We used google sheets to create our favicon. We had 32 bits to work with when creating our favicon. A favicon is the little website image that you see on top of the URL. I choose to do a flower and the character my melody because I love flowers and my melody is one of my favorite charactera from sanrio. I added the favicon to the page by screenshotting it which made the image png. Then I uploaded it into replit. We first added all the tag that are needed for an html website (html, head,body,title, and the doctype tag along with the closing tags for the ones that need it). Then in the head tag we used "link rel="" type="" href="" to upload the favicon so when we open our lab in a separete page the image at the top corner will be our favicon. Then we used "link style="" rel="" href="" to add the css link. </p>
